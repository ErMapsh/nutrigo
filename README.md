# Assignment

### Used packages
1. react-native-vector-icons- there are serval lib, but I chose this library cause I like material UI. and this lib icons made up from material icons
2. redux-toolkit: for global state management and easy
3. react-navigation: for screen navigation
4. react native ui lib: some features like expandable sections are not in React native paper so I got with this lib
5. react native paper: Again the main reason is material ui
6. react native element dropdown: the latest best and optimized dropdown I have used
7. Zod: never used it before but its makes my work easier for validation, and In the future, i will use it in every program of mine
8. date-fns for date and time conversion is perfect lib rather than writing core code.
9. react-native-alert-notification: give application reach look and UI experience
